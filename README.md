# Assigned_Goldman_Sachs_Project-

## Summary and Purpose of Project 

Julian was assigned a summer project from a Quant Researcher and VP at Goldman Sachs designed to help him gain practical experience in data analysis and quantitative finance using Python. The project involves analyzing daily closing price data of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), implementing a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast future prices, and presenting the findings in a PowerPoint presentation.

Julian later delivered a great presentation explaining his findings in PowerPoint to his Mentor, a Vice President & Quant at Goldman Sachs.

## Key Insights, Tools & Data

I was tasked with Forecasting the Prices of the S&P 500 ETF using Python and a Monte Carlo Simulation. Before I performed the Monte Carlo Simulation I first performed an EDA on data gathered from Yahoo Finance. Then I ran the Monte Carlo Simulation from which I found valuable insights using Python(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlob, Seaborn) into the value, risk, and return of the S&P 500 ETF years into the future. These insights came from finding the Var, CVar, Drawdown and Probabilities of metrics such as the return ranges, volatility ranges and price ranges of the Monte Carlo Simulation. Once I had calculated the forecasted and calculated metrics using Python and Jupyter Lab I created a PowerPoint Presenation with my findings and presented it to a VP and Quant at Goldman Sachs.
